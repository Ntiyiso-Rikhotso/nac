                  <p><strong>HELICOPTER TOUR PACKAGES</strong> <br /><br /> <strong> PRETORIA / HARTBEESPORT TOUR</strong> <br />
                     <br /> Departing from Grand Central Airport in Midrand, you fly Northbound, routing along the N1 Highway towards the sprawling developments of Pretoria East. <br />
                     <br />Coming into Pretoria CBD from the south-eastern side, you will immediately recognise the landmarks that make the South African Capital City as impressive as it is. One can see the majestic Union Buildings (constructed in 1913 and now the current office of the president); Loftus stadium; Pretoria University; the Zoo, and several other iconic and administrative buildings within the City Centre. <br />

                     Leaving the CBD behind and flying westward, we follow the magnificent Magaliesberg mountain range; these quartzite cliffs head towards Hartbeespoort Dam. According to Geologists, these are among the oldest mountains in the world, almost 100 times older than Everest. Your view from the sky is truly the best way to appreciate the exquisite scenery below. While flying around the town and dam wall, you will understand why Hartbeespoort is one of the most popular tourist and hiking destinations in Gauteng, South Africa. <br />
                     <br /> Routing south-east back to Midrand, you will have the option to overfly either Lanseria Airport or Atteridgeville Township. Landing for lunch is an option on this leg of the flight, depending on the aforementioned decision. 
                     <br /> Alternatively, the route can be flown in reverse and departure from Lanseria Airport can be arranged. 
                     <br><br>This flight would be approximately 1 hour excluding time on the ground for your meal. Additionally, we can add to your tour, champagne, canap&eacute;s or flowers. Please ask us for a quote as prices are frequently subject to change.

                     <br /> Continuing along the M1, you see Melrose Arch, Rosebank, and the impressive houses of Houghton Estate. <br />

				<h3 class="title_bold text-center">Aircraft Leasing </h3>
				<p>
					Awesome Flight Logistics and Awesome Asset Securities are a further collaboration with Awesome Aviation in the asset leasing and ownership business.  Leasing is a popular preference, enabling the operation of aircraft without the financial burden of ownership and providing a profitable increase in capacity.
					<br><br>
					The value derived from leasing includes freeing up capital, flexibility as requirements change and mitigation of risk, all of which frequently result in the development of long term partnerships with leasing clients.  Our aircraft undergo comprehensive pre-delivery checks and are delivered fully compliant and ready to work.
					<br><br>
					Monthly lease payments commence upon delivery, with engine HSI and engine, propeller and landing gear overhauls covered via hourly provisions to avoid costly interventions for the operator.  Our operators are placed in direct contact with our network of suppliers, OEM and factory support, ensuring cost-effective "at source" parts procurement.

         NAC's helicopter pilot training is conducted at Rand and Grand Central Airports. The school has extensive experience in training from ab-initio to advanced commercial qualifications and our graduates have gone on to become captains with helicopter operators across Africa and the world. Our programmes include Instrument Rating, Instructors Rating, Conversion Training, Game Capture and Cull Ratings, External Load Rating, and all types of advanced pilot training.
         <br><br>
         The Rand Airport and Grand Central Airport helicopter pilot training operation is populated by student pilots and qualified pilots seeking advanced training. These training facilities are mostly utilised by owner pilots, from ab-initio training on the Robinson type helicopters to more advanced training on Bell types.

         <br>
         <p>
            The NAC Training infrastructure includes an administration centre, operations room and pilot lecture hall. The helicopters are maintained by NAC’s own on-site aircraft maintenance organisation with engine overhaul capability, which is useful in teaching pilots a practical understanding of the more technical aspects of the course. Feel free to contact NAC’s flight school for more information.

         <b>EXPERTISE</b>
         <br>
         <p>
            Private and commercial flying requires a lot more than controlling an aircraft correctly and accurately; a pilot also needs effective and adaptable procedural capabilities, applied operational knowledge and confident pilot command skills. All these are taught through training and then practiced through planned exposure to various conditions and situations.
            <br><br>
            NAC Training has identified specific objectives for all these aspects and designed step-by-step, logically structured pilot training programmes. Pilot theory and practical training are integrated throughout the programme, and every dual and solo hour is used strategically for maximum productivity where there is no unstructured “hour building”. Management programmes monitor your progress and performance, addressing problems and providing corrective action.
         </p>
         <b>EXPERIENCE</b>
         <br>
         <p>
            The school has extensive experience in training a wide spectrum of pilots. Some graduates have gone on to become captains and first officers with a wide variety of operators across Africa, as well as different helicopter charter operators in southern Africa.
            <br><br>
            We also cater for other ratings such as Instrument Rating, Instructors Rating, Conversion Training, Game Catch/ Cull Ratings, External Load Ratingand all types of advanced pilot training including mountain flying. Courses can be structured in such a way as to suit your pilot training requirements. Contact us today to begin a thrilling, challenging and rewarding pilot training programme.

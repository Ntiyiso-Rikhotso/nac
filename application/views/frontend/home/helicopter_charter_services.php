                  <br><br>
                  NAC provides specialist assistance in applications such as fire-fighting, construction hoisting and cargo slinging. Our pilots have significant slinging and lifting experience in both the military and civilian sectors and our Helicopter Operations division has the equipment needed for a variety of slinging operations.

                  Our crews also offer extensive expertise in game capture and counting, high value cargo delivery, geological surveys and mine and powerline inspections. 
                  <br><br>
                  The photographic and film production sector need look no further than NAC. We have worked with the industry’s top professionals for many years and can assist with the hiring of equipment designed for specific use onboard helicopters.
                  Aero-medical emergency services can mean the difference between life and death. NAC operates several helicopters equipped with state-of-the-art EMS equipment that can be hired for patient transport or as standby for sporting and other events.

                  We proudly operate multiple helicopters around the continent which are available for private charter. These helicopters all have executive interiors, air conditioning and are maintained at the highest safety standards. This fast growing sector of the helicopter industry has become very specialized, and with that being said, we currently operate several fully IFR twin-engine helicopters. These aircraft operate when all-weather capability, day or night, is essential. Charters can be arranged to land at venues, events, game farms, stadiums, etc.
